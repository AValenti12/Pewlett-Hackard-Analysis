# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


The purpose of this project was to help Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis create two tables to identify and view the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to partcipate in a mentorship program. 

# Results

- The total number of employees retiring is 90,398 

- There are 57,668 senior employees retiring, that encompases 63% of the retiring staff.

- Total number of engineering employees retiring including engineer and senior engineer retiring is 43,636, which is 48% of the retiring staff.

- There are 1,549 employees qualify for the mentorship program.


# Summary

There will be 90,398 roles that will need to be filled as soon as the workforce starts retiring. There are not enough qualified employees to mentor the next generation as there are only 1,940 employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. When looking further into mentorship eligibility per deparment you get the following table.

Seeing there will not be enough mentors to train the new employees, a possible solution would be to expand the mentorship eligibility to add more mentors. By changing the mentorship eligibility dates (1/1/1964-12/31/1966), you increase the amount of mentors to 19,905.
