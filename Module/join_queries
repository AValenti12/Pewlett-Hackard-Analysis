-- 'SELECT' statement selects only the columns we want to view from each table
-- 'FROM' statement points to the first table to be joined, Departments (Table 1)
-- 'INNER JOIN' points to the second table to be joined, dept_manager (Table 2)
-- 'ON departments.dept_no = managers.dept_no;' indicates where Postgres should look for matches

-- 'SELECT COUNT' gives us the total number of employees
-- 'LEFT JOIN' was used because we wanted all employee numbers from Table 1 to be included
-- 'GROUP BY' gives us the number of employees retiring from each department
-- 'ORDER BY' puts the output data in order
